Following with my previous post [Dry-web-roda part 1](http://gustavocaso.github.io/2017/05/dry-web-roda-for-rails-developers_part_i/) I decided to create my own small website for keeping track of all the things I learn through the day.

Yes I know another Today I Learned Website ðŸ˜“ - [til_web](https://github.com/GustavoCaso/til_web).

This time I started by the persistence layer and I wanted to share with you my experience.

First of all we will need [dry-web-roda](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-web-roda) to work as our web application stack,
when creating a new project with it, we have two options regarding the architecture point of view of our application: `umbrella` or `flat`.

Umbrella means that our functionality will be divided into sub-apps for example the public site and the admin site.
Flat is a simpler architecture, with a single module for the entire app.

In my app I decided to use the `flat` option for simplicity at the beginning, but in the future I plan to move to sub-apps.

<!-- more -->

Let's start by creating our new application `$ dry-web-roda new til_web --arch=flat` it will generate the file structure.

I will focus mostly in the persistence part.

To start we have to create our new development database, the name is extracted from the name of the project in this case `til_web_development` all the information regarding the `ENV` is located in the `.env` in the root of the project. All of the environment variables are loaded by `Dry::Web::Settings`

At the moment we only support `pg` postgres as database storage. I find super easy the [postgres app](https://postgresapp.com/) for installing and everything.

To create the database we can use some of the commands that postgres app install for us, `$ create_db -h localhost til_web_development` that simple.

Let's continue with our migrations files `dry-web-roda` use [rom-rb](http://rom-rb.org/) as his ORM that allow us to have a clean separation of responsibilities and make an app that remains easy to change.

For creating the migrations file we delegate it to rom-rb - `$ bundle exec rake db:create_migration[add_author]`, will create a new file inside our `db/migrate` folder.

Once we open the file:

```ruby
ROM::SQL.migration do
  change do
  end
end
```

 Rom use [sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel) as the database migration engine. There is this great documentation about migrations [Sequel documentation](http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/files/doc/schema_modification_rdoc.html)

 We continue by creating a table and adding some fields to it.

```ruby
 ROM::SQL.migration do
  change do
    create_table :tils do
      primary_key :id

      column :title, String, null: false
      column :text, 'text', null: false
      column :created_at, DateTime,  null: false, default: Sequel::CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
      column :updated_at, DateTime, null: false, default: Sequel::CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    end
  end
end
```

 Once happy with our migration we can run `$ bundle exec rake db:migrate`, it will create our new table.

 Now we are reading to start looking at the file structure of our project and create some [Relations](http://rom-rb.org/learn/sql/relations/), [Commands](http://rom-rb.org/learn/sql/commands/) and [Repositories](http://rom-rb.org/learn/repositories/quick-start/)

 Inside our `lib/persistence` folder we have `relations` and `commands` folders.

 Relations are the interface to a particular collection in our data source, which in SQL terms is either a table or a view. We could think them as our models.

```ruby
 module Persistence
  module Relations
    class Tils < ROM::Relation[:sql]
      schema(:tils) do
        attribute :id, Types::Serial
        attribute :title, Types::Strict::String
        attribute :text, Types::Strict::String
      end

      def by_id(id)
        where(id: id)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

 We need to define a [schema](http://rom-rb.org/learn/core/schemas/) and some composable, reusable query methods to return filtered results from our database table `by_id` this methods will be use by our repositories.

 Them we create a new [Command](http://rom-rb.org/learn/advanced/commands/), inside our `commands` folder, they are use to interact with the database `Create`, `Update` and `Delete`.

```ruby
 module Persistence
  module Commands
    class CreateTil < ROM::Commands::Create[:sql]
      relation :tils
      register_as :create
      result :one
    end
  end
end
```

And the last step is to create our `Repository` it works as the main interface to interact with our Database, having them been a separate object, they ensure the rest of the app doesn't have any coupling to the implementation details of our data source.

For my project I created the folder `repositories` inside the `til_web`, that would be [auto_register](http://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-system/container/) thanks to `dry-system`. We can see that in our [container.rb](https://github.com/GustavoCaso/til_web/blob/master/system/til_web/container.rb#L9)


```ruby
require 'til_web/repository'

module TilWeb
  module Repositories
    class Tils < TilWeb::Repository[:tils]
      def [](id)
        tils.by_id(id).one!
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Our last step is to create some sample data so we can play with it in the `console`.

We open our `sample_data.rb` file.

```ruby
# need the application to be booted in order to access their container.
require_relative '../system/boot'
require 'faker'


def create_til(attrs)
  # this line is use to access the rom container, that is created at the botting process
  # of the application.
  # inside the `system/boot/rom.rb`
  TilWeb::Container['persistence.rom'].commands[:tils][:create].call(attrs)
end

20.times do
  create_til(
    title: Faker::Lorem.sentence(4),
    text: Faker::Lorem.paragraph(5)
  )
end
```

After running `$ bundle exec rake db:sample_data` we can check that everything has been created by stepping in the `console`, by typing `$ bin/console`

To access the repository we type `TilWeb::Conatiner['repositories.tils']` that will return an instance of `TilWeb::Repositories::Tils` with all its dependencies.

And lastly we can check that there are data in the database by writing `TilWeb::Container['repositories.tils'][1]` this is the method that we have defined above in our repository class.

```
> TilWeb::Container['repositories.tils'][1]
=> #<ROM::Struct::Til id=1 title="Illo qui laborum dolores." text="Illum laboriosam adipisci incidunt. Ad aliquam ratione non adipisci quia velit. Veritatis eum minus ut quod mollitia sit. Ea tenetur aliquam fugit mollitia. Rerum ratione et dignissimos a et enim necessitatibus. Animi nesciunt qui rerum voluptatem ipsum atque ad.">
```

At thats it ðŸŽ‰.

I know some concepts are quite different than what we are use to work with, and I could keep talking about them, but the post is getting quite long. Thanks so much for reading.

If you have any thoughts or questions, please share and Iâ€™ll be happy to answer in the comments.
