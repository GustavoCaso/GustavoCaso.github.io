It has been a while since I blog üò•

A lot has happened in the last six months.

I started working for an English company based in London as a remote developer; I always wanted to work with an entirely distributed team. The experience was great. It gave me the flexibility I sought, and I never felt lonely or ran a solo mission against the code.

It is true that some things could have been improved, like the communication channels or how often we would hang out, but hey, everything could be better.

The summer has ended, and now some changes are coming.

I had the great opportunity to come to Montreal, Canada, to work for [Shopify](https://www.shopify.ca/) as a production engineer. As you can imagine, I took the chance without blinking.

After some thought about my current situation, I decided to level up my game and start getting more serious with how I face new opportunities for learning (As I predict there will be a lot üéâ with my new role).

I decided to blog as much as possible and share what I learned in this new stage. That way, I will improve my writing skills and have an archive where I can always come back looking for answers. Following this train of thought, I will read more, not just programming books. It is a great habit that can affect not only your professional life but your personal life as well. Here is an excellent [article](https://medium.com/s/story/the-simple-truth-behind-reading-200-books-a-year-1767cb03af20) about that subject.

I'm going to listen more and try not to shout out everything that pops into my head, or at least I'm going to think about it twice üßê.

Also, I want to learn a new programming language different from [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). I was thinking maybe [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) or [Go](https://golang.org/). That way, I can learn new concepts and bring them to my daily job.

Not to forget to keep helping as much as possible with OSS, especially with [dry-rb](https://dry-rb.org/), [rom-rb](https://rom-rb.org/) and [Hanami](http://hanamirb.org/) but keeping an eye open for new and exciting projects.

I know the list above is not small or simple to achieve; there has to be room for social life and daily exercise; I need to find an agenda that works for me. (I will share it once I find out üòÅ)

I will keep everyone posted.
