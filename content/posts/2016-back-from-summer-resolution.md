After a long vacation, I came with a lot of energy and new goals for the new year.

So I'm going to start making things right. Being a developer can be challenging, and you have to continuously update your knowledge and keep practicing even outside office hours. Don't get me wrong, I love coding, but there are days or weeks when I'm lazier than usual.

I will use some Todo apps to manage my free time and create a timetable of small but doable goals to solve this situation.

Here is a list of some of my goals:

1. Blog once a week: The post doesn't need to be highly technical, but the idea is to blog about something I learn every week, maybe a new `Design Pattern` or a new way of dealing with stress.
2. Learn Elixir.
3. Learn React.
4. Learn new ways to improve my ruby skills: I've been reading about using Functional Programming with OO principles lately. So I have an eye on the great work of [Piotr Solnica](http://solnic.eu/).
I will try creating some gems following this new `dry-rb` concept.

So hope you guys come to join me in this new year of goals and challenges.
